# APGenX DSL Syntax README

## Introduction

The purpose of this README is to document how the APGenX DSL is formally defined as a context-free language, using the GNU tools yacc and lex or, more precisely, their 'modern' equivalents, bison and flex.

The DSL grammar is generated by a program called gramgen; the gramgen source code resides in parser\_util. The README there provides documentation about how it works. In the present document, we concentrate on the main input to gramgen, which is a text file named skeleton.txt, and how the information in skeleton.txt is used to generate a yacc-conforming syntax file.

This README is a work in progress - actually, a work just started. In the meantime, some insight can be found in the original [APGenX design notes](../../../../doc/APGenDSLparser.pdf).


## The skeleton file

An APGenX adaptation file has a relatively simple structure:

1. a header
2. global variable definitions 
3. function definitions
4. resource definitions
5. abstract resource definition
6. activity type definitions
7. constraint definitions
8. activity instance definitions
