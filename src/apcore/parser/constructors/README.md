# APGenX Parser Constructors README

## Introduction

The purpose of this README is to document the details of the mechanism used by gramgen, the APGenX grammar generator, to create rule-specific constructors for the various objects described in an APGenX adaptation file.

This README is a work in progress. Until it reaches some level of maturity, the following documents will provide at least some useful information:
1. Comments in [the skeleton file](../syntax/skeleton.txt).
2. [the APGen DSL parser document](../../../../doc/APGenDSLparser.pdf)
