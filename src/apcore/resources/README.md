# Technical README for the APGenX resource classes

## Introduction

Ultimately, this README will provide extensive documentation on all aspects of APGenX resources. As documenting the APGenX is an ongoing process that started in earnest in Summer 2019, it may be a while before that goal is achieved. The top priority at the beginning of this documentation effort concerns resource usage and evaluation, because those are the two aspects that involve complex interactions between the modeling, multithreading and output capabilities of APGenX. The best way to deal with complexity is to reduce it to many simple elements, and that is what the various README's are seeking to accomplish, including this one.
