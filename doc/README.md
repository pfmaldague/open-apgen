# open-apgen Documentation

This directory contains a few documents of interest:

  - [The Space Ops paper](./APGenSchedulingSpaceOps.pdf) retraces the evolution of APGen and its companion sequencing application, SEQGEN, which was also developed at JPL and is used to simulate onboard execution of spacecraft sequences.
  - [The DSL Design paper](./APGenDSLparser.pdf) explains the design of the APGen parser. It also describes in some detail the thinking behind the built-in APGen execution engine, which underwent significant refactoring when the Europa Clipper mission started using APGen to simulate the entire mission.
  - [The A++ powerpoint presentation](./Aplusplus.pptx) describes an attempt to answer the question "Could you avoid the DSL and write APGen adaptation in C++ instead?" The question has some merit, because most programmers are very fond of their favorite programming language(s). They feel that a DSL is too constraining and awkward for regular use. The presentation summarizes a 2-month attempt to reproduce some of the main features of the APGen DSL in C++. While the tone of the presentation is fairly positive and suggests that the answer to the question is "yes", the unanimous reaction from engineers who actually used the DSL was very negative because of their lack of familiarity with C++. In hindsight, the conclusion of the presentation should have been a resounding "no" answer to the question posed at the beginning. The DSL may be a poor substitute for existing general-purpose languages, but it does a very good job of encapsulating sophisticated constructs that are extremely helpful in writing bug-free simulation algorithms. Trying to create such constructs reliably with a general-purpose language is extremely difficult, because it takes enormous insight and discipline to define and then stick to patterns that work.
