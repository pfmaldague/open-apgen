# open-apgen

open-apgen is the open-source version of the APGenX application developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA. The initial version of open-apgen, version O.1, is identical with version X.9.1 of JPL's APGenX as far as the C++ code is concerned. However, JPL-specific interfaces and documentation files have been eliminated or modified in the open-source version.
