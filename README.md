# open-apgen

## Inheritance

open-apgen is the open-source version of the APGenX application developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA. The initial version of open-apgen, version O.1, is identical with version X.9.1 of JPL's APGenX as far as the C++ code is concerned. However, JPL-specific interfaces and documentation files have been eliminated or modified in the open-source version.

##Documentation

Over the years, a number of papers about APGen have been presented at SpaceOps meetings. The papers are available from the spaceops archive at the following web site:

	arc.aiaa.org/seqies/6.spaceops

Some of these papers are available in the ./doc subdirectory of the open-apen repository.
